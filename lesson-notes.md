### Notes

- It's rare for programmers to use just one type of data -- a single data type -- in their scripts
- Commonly used Python data types include:
  - strings (text data)
  - numeric (such as **floating-point** numbers or **integers**)
  - lists
  - tuples
  - dictionaries
  - Boolean (True or False values)
- The built-in Python `input( )` function always returns a string (text data)
  - To do math when using the `input( )` function, you have to convert the string data the `input( )` function gives you to either a **floating-point** number (by using the `float ( )` function together with the `input ( )` function) OR an integer (using the `int( )` function together with the `input( )` function
  - Example: See the code snippet under [*Type Conversion in Python*](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/numbers)
